## Introduction
There is a plethora of tutorials on OpenCV on the internet, but none of them provide real-time testing functionality. This app aids in real-time analysis of basic image processing functions in OpenCV.

**Advantages**:
*	A better understanding of function outputs.
*	A better understanding of the effect of change in parameter values on the output image.
*	A better understanding of the effect of one image processing method on top of another.

*My goal here is to make learning of OpenCV, fun and understandable.*
